- release 2,
- added "%triggerpostun -- dhcp < 3.0" script with add on top dhcpd.conf
  "ddns-update-style none;" line if not exist. Thos allow smooth upgrade from
  < 3.0 dhcp to current because new dhcpd requires in dhcpd.conf entry with info
  about dynamic dns update style handling. This trigger by default adds
  disabled ddns update.
